        I am a third year Software Engineering student and I am passionate about
        software development and information technologies. During my studies, I
        acquired a solid foundation in programming, algorithms and software
        design. I also developed practical skills using programming languages

      Online learning site (React
      /MongoDB/Mongoose/Node.js/Nest.js/JavaScript/CSS/HTML/BOOSTRAP) : I
      participated in the design of an online learning platform, using React and
      Node.js, with a NoSQL MongoDB database. This platform allows students to
      manage their profile, take quizzes, follow courses, while teachers can
      administer courses, sections, quizzes and categories. The user-friendly
      interface was created with React, and Node.js was used to manage
      interactions with the MongoDB database

      Flight booking (PHP/SQL/HTML/CSS/JS) : I participated in the creation of a
      flight booking application using PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This
      application allows users to view available flights, select their itinerary
      and book their tickets. It uses an SQL database to store flight
      information and updates available seats in real time. The user-friendly
      interface was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while PHP was used
      to manage transactions with the database.
